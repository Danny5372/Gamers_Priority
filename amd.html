                <p> AMD "Zen 3" is here, and we have with us the Ryzen 9 5950X, the absolute king of the series. <br>
                    This 16-core/32-thread processor is designed to bring the HEDT (high-end desktop) segment down <br>
                    to the mainstream desktop platform; that is, for those who don't care much about a quad-channel <br>
                    memory interface or tons of PCIe lanes. The fact that HEDT chips don't dominate mainstream chips <br>
                    at gaming goes to show that quad-channel isn't all that relevant to the client desktop segment. <br>
                    With the 5950X, you could get yourself HEDT-kind multi-core muscle, higher memory clock headroom <br>
                    to make up the bandwidth deficit, and a more affordable platform since the 5950X is compatible <br>
                    with even mainstream chipsets, such as the AMD B550.</p>
                    
                <p style="margin-right: 15px;"> The AMD Ryzen 5 5950X in this review uses the "Zen 3" architecture, which is a combination of    <br>
                    micro and macro changes to the "Zen" architecture. At a macro level, we see AMD practically doing <br>
                    away with the 4-core CCX design, resulting in each of the two 7 nm "Zen 3" chiplets having a <br>
                    monolithic group of eight cores sharing a large 32 MB L3 cache. At a micro-level, AMD has invested <br>
                    heavily in improving the various components inside the core, resulting in that sweet 19% IPC gain. <br>
                    Together, the higher IPC cores and improved multi-core topology should put the 5950X on firmer <br>
                    ground against not just Intel's LGA1200 "Comet Lake" parts, but also its Core X "Cascade Lake-X" <br>
                    parts that go up to 18 cores.</p>

                <p style="margin-right:14px;"> AMD is launching the Ryzen 9 5950X at $799, making it the priciest mainstream desktop processor, <br>
                    which is right up there with HEDT parts. Since this is a Socket AM4 part that doesn't temper down <br>
                    its clock speeds to afford such a large core count, AMD claims that the 5950X will give you the <br>
                    best of both worlds: leadership AAA gaming performance and productivity that can potentially save <br>
                    you hundreds of dollars compared to an HEDT.

                </video>
                <p> The AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT is here! This is the company's new flagship graphics card, targeted at maxed <br>
                    out gaming at 4K UHD resolution with raytracing enabled. The Radeon RX 6900 XT was announced alongside <br>
                    the RX 6800 XT and RX 6800 back in October—today is the launch. The new RX 6900 XT is based on the same <br>
                    7 nm Navi 21 silicon, but maxes it out with all its shaders enabled, the highest clock speeds among the <br>
                    three cards, and the highest possible overclocking headroom. AMD in its October announcement for the RX <br>
                    6000 series stunned the gaming community by announcing that its latest cards offer competitive performance <br>
                    with NVIDIA—the RX 6800 XT is in the same performance league as the RTX 3080, and the RX 6900 XT gets close <br>
                    to the RTX 3090 while beating the RTX 3080.</p>

                <p> For the most part, the RX 6800 XT and RX 6800 lived up to their hype, with the RX 6800 beating the RTX 3070 <br>
                    and the RX 6800 XT trading blows with the RTX 3080, but only in the majority of our game tests that lack <br>
                    real-time raytracing. With raytracing enabled, the RX 6800 series cards perform closer to previous-generation  <br>
                    high-end "Turing" models, such as the RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Ti. Still, there's enough for AMD to claim a return <br>
                    to the high-end graphics segment after many years. The new RX 6900 XT being launched today offers the very best <br>
                    from this generation and is targeted at enthusiasts or gamers who want the best AMD has to offer for 4K gaming. 
                </p>

                <p style="margin-left: 10px;"> The Radeon RX 6900 XT is being launched at an SEP price of $999, which lets it sit in the vast pricing gorge <br>
                    between the $700 RTX 3080 and $1,500 RTX 3090. If AMD is claiming that the card trades blows with the RTX 3090, <br>
                    it must beat the RTX 3080 to justify the $300 higher price and get close enough to the RTX 3090 to lure in buyers <br>
                    with the $500 lower price.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-left:36px"> The RX 6900 XT is based on AMD's new RDNA2 graphics architecture, which debuted earlier this year with the GPU that <br>
                    powers the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. This is important for AMD's RX 6000 series, as game developers build <br>
                    their game engines around consoles first since that's where the money is, and it minimizes effort for them to optimize <br>
                    their games for the RDNA2 architecture on the PC. The biggest feature addition with RDNA2 is full DirectX 12 Ultimate <br>
                    API support, which includes real-time raytracing using the DXR API, Mesh Shaders, Variable Rate Shading (both tier-1 <br>
                    and tier-2), and Sampler Feedback. AMD has also bolstered the card's feature set with an updated Radeon Anti-Lag, <br>
                    support for DirectStorage API, and resizable BAR (Smart Access Memory).
