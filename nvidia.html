                <p style="text-align: justify;"> The TITAN V is an enthusiast-class graphics card by NVIDIA, launched in December 2017. Built on the 12 <br>
                    nm process, and based on the GV100 graphics processor, in its GV100- 400-A1 variant, the card supports <br>
                    DirectX 12. This ensures that all modern games will run on TITAN V. The GV100 graphics processor is a <br>
                    large chip with a die area of 815 mm² and 21,100 million transistors. It features 5120 shading units, <br>
                    320 texture mapping units, and 96 ROPs. Also included are 640 tensor cores which help improve the speed <br>
                    of machine learning applications. NVIDIA has paired 12 GB HBM2 memory with the TITAN V, which are <br>
                    connected using a 3072-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a frequency of 1200 MHz, which can <br>
                    be boosted up to 1455 MHz, memory is running at 848 MHz. Being a dual-slot card, the NVIDIA TITAN V <br>
                    draws power from 1x 6-pin + 1x 8-pin power connector, with power draw rated at 250 W maximum. Display <br>
                    outputs include: 1x HDMI, 3x DisplayPort. TITAN V is connected to the rest of the system using a PCI- <br>
                    Express 3.0 x16 interface. The card's dimensions are 267 mm x 112 mm x 40 mm, and it features a dual- <br>
                    slot cooling solution. Its price at launch was 2999 US Dollars.

                <p style="text-align: justify;"> The GeForce RTX 3090 is an enthusiast-class graphics card by NVIDIA, launched in September 2020. Built <br>
                    on the 8 nm process, and based on the GA102 graphics processor, in its GA102-300-A1 variant, the card <br>
                    supports DirectX 12 Ultimate. This ensures that all modern games will run on GeForce RTX 3090. Additionally, <br>
                    the DirectX 12 Ultimate capability guarantees support for hardware-raytracing, variable-rate shading and <br>
                    more, in upcoming video games. The GA102 graphics processor is a large chip with a die area of 628 mm² <br>
                    and 28,300 million transistors. It features 10496 shading units, 328 texture mapping units, and 112 ROPs. <br>
                    Also included are 328 tensor cores which help improve the speed of machine learning applications. The card <br>
                    also has 82 raytracing acceleration cores. NVIDIA has paired 24 GB GDDR6X memory with the GeForce RTX 3090, <br>
                    which are connected using a 384-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a frequency of 1395 MHz, which <br>
