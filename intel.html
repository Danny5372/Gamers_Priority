                <p> Current Strongest Gaming CPU: <br>
                    Intel Core i9-10900K Processor DirectX 12.00
                </p>

                </video>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"> The Core i9-10900K is based on Intel's new "Comet Lake" microarchitecture that made its debut with <br>
                    the mobile 10th generation Core series. It is hopefully the last derivative of the company's 4-year <br>
                    old "Skylake" microarchitecture. When Intel launched its 6-core "Coffee Lake" silicon as its first <br>
                    response to "Zen," we had hoped that would be the last iteration of "Skylake," which wasn't to be. <br>
                    The following year, Intel increased the core count to eight, hoping it would be unbeatable by AMD. <br>
                    "Zen 2" surprised everyone, not just with its double-digit IPC gains, but also core count increases <br>
                    to 12 and 16 on the mainstream AM4 socket. Evidently, Intel's 10 nm nod aren't ready for volume <br>
                    production of desktop processors, and so Intel went back to the drawing board to stretch the silicon <br>
                    one last time by adding two more cores.</p>
                    
                <p style="margin-right: -45px;text-align: justify;">
                    With Comet Lake, Intel introduces a new desktop platform built around the new LGA1200 socket and <br>
                    Intel 400- series chipset. Development of a new package isn't just consistent with Intel's roadmap <br>
                    of spanning a new desktop platform with no more than two processor generations, but also necessitated <br>
                    by the steep power requirements of the Core i9-10900K. To stand a chance against AMD's "Zen 2," it wasn't <br>
                    enough that Intel just add more cores, they also had to beef up the power delivery capability of these <br>
                    new processors to sustain higher clock speeds, which explains why more pins are required. Besides just <br>
                    increasing the number of cores to ten on the Core i9-10900K flagship, Intel also added innovation with <br>
                    clock-speed management, using up to three separate boosting algorithms. This helps the Core i9-10900K <br>
                    hold on to higher clock speeds, and spread the increased frequencies among its cores better.</p>

                <p style="margin-right:-30px;text-align: justify;"> 
                    Generally, with Comet Lake, Intel is shoring up multi-threaded performance across the lineup. The Core <br>
                    i9 series is now 10-core/20-thread with the introduction of the new die. The Core i7 series, which was <br>
                    8-core/ 8-thread with 12 MB L3 cache in the 9th generation, is now 8-core/16-thread with 16 MB L3 cache <br>
                    (identical configuration to the 9th generation Core i9-9900). The Core i5 series now consists of 6-core <br>
                    /12-thread parts  with 12 MB L3 cache (identical configuration to the 8th generation Core i7-8700), up <br>
                    from its 9th and 8th  generation predecessors being 6-core/6-thread parts with 9 MB L3 cache. The 10th <br>
                    generation Core i3 chips are 4-core/8-thread with 8 MB L3 cache (identical configuration to the 7th <br>
                    generation Core i7-7700), up from its predecessors being 4-core/4-thread. See what Intel did here? It <br>
                    tapped into previous-gen hardware IP it already had, re-positioning them at progressively lower price <br>
                    points.

                <p style="text-align: justify;"> The Iris Xe MAX Graphics is a mobile graphics chip by Intel, launched in October 2020. Built on the 10 <br>
                    nm process, and based on the DG1 graphics processor, the chip supports DirectX 12. This ensures that all <br>
                    modern games will run on Iris Xe MAX Graphics. The DG1 graphics processor is a relatively small chip <br>
                    with a die area of only 77 mm². It features 768 shading units, 48 texture mapping units, and 24 ROPs. <br>
                    Intel has paired 4 GB LPDDR4X memory with the Iris Xe MAX Graphics, which are connected using a 128-bit <br>
                    memory interface. The GPU is operating at a frequency of 300 MHz, which can be boosted up to 1650 MHz, <br>
                    memory is running at 2133 MHz. Its power draw is rated at 25 W maximum. This device has no display <br>
                    connectivity, as it is not designed to have monitors connected to it. Rather it is intended for use in <br>
                    laptop/notebooks and will use the output of the host mobile device. Iris Xe MAX Graphics is connected to  <br>
                    the rest of the system using a PCI-Express 4.0 x4 interface.
